gh-pages branch contains the distributable version of the react app created through the npm package gh-pages. It contains the ultimate version of the website! it has been deployed using gh-pages branch here: https://kelly-ryoo.github.io/treehacks/
code branch contains the source files. unfortunately, the organization got messed up + a file was lost in the process of deploying :( and I could not figure out how to restore it. but the important source code is still there!
